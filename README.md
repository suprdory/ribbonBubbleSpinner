# ribbonBubbleSpinner
Arduino controlled motor for auto spinning the magic iridescent ribbon bubble stick.

I was given this amazing rainbow bubble ribbon wand as a gift and thought it would look great getting on with its business in the corner of the room by itself.

Driving the motor from the arduino alone didn't provide enough power and transitions were sluggish, so I brought in the L298N motor driver. Never quite got this right, however; there was always a bit of an unsettling wobble. Probably could have just shortened the stick but I didn't want to ruin the beautiful gift.

My favourite bit of the project was the beautiful little brass coupler.
